# Community Profile Instructions
Note: these instructions are incomplete, just a working draft.

There are 2 options to share your information with the community.

## BioDrop
The first option is to use [BioDrop](https://www.biodrop.io/), run by [Eddie Jaoude](https://www.biodrop.io/eddiejaoude).

Here are instructions on how to [create your profile on BioDrop with JSON](https://www.biodrop.io/docs/quickstart-json) or [create a BioDrop profile with forms](https://www.biodrop.io/docs/quickstart-forms) if you prefer.

Once you have a profile created, add a new row to the [community members table](../community-members.md#members-list) and add your name and BioDrop link.

Then create a Pull Request.

## Community Profile
Use the [Community Profile Template](../Templates/community-profiles-template.md) to add your information.

Clone the template to the [Community-profiles folder](../Community-profiles/) and then rename it to Your GitHub handle or your name (without spaces) followed by `.md`.

Once you have completed your profile, add a new row to the [community members table](../community-members.md#members-list) and add your name and the link to your profile (use relative links, so it should be in the format `Community-profiles/<<your-name>>.md`).

Then create a Pull Request.
